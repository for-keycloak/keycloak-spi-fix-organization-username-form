## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for testing)

### Building

Using just:
```bash
# Build for the default Keycloak version (26.2.5)
just build
```


### Testing with Docker Compose

A docker-compose configuration is provided for testing, which includes:

- Keycloak server with the spi installed (accessible at http://localhost:8080)

Start the environment:
```bash
just build # Builds the spi
just up    # Starts Keycloak with the spi
```

```bash
# You can use admin/admin as the default credentials
```

```bash
just down  # Stops the environment
```

Access:
- Keycloak: http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin)


## Supported Keycloak Versions

The authenticator is built and tested with multiple Keycloak versions:

- 26.2.5

While the builds differ slightly for each version, the core functionality remains the same. The version-specific builds ensure compatibility and proper integration with each Keycloak release.


## Development Notes

The project uses:

- Maven for building
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for common development tasks
- Docker & Docker Compose for testing
